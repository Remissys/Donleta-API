# Donleta - Discord Bot for Competitive Genshin Impact

**Donleta** is a Discord bot integrated with the Google Sheets API, designed to manage and track the results of a casual *Genshin Impact* competition. In each round, two characters are randomly selected to fight against a randomly chosen boss. The time taken to defeat the boss, along with the characters' scores, determines the final result of the competition.

The competition is hosted by streamer [**don_nobru**](https://www.twitch.tv/don_nobru) on Twitch. If you want to watch the rounds live or participate in the competition, check out his streams! The **competitive Donleta** takes place from Wednesday to Friday starting at 22:00 UTC-3, and there is a **casual competition** in pairs every Saturday, also at 22:00 UTC-3.

## How does the competition work?

The competition is based on randomly drawn characters and bosses. Each character and boss has an assigned score, and the time it takes to defeat the boss adds additional points to the result. After each round, the bot logs the results, allowing users to check their scores through the commands listed above.

### **Monthly Scoring System**:
For the monthly ranking, the user’s total score is determined by the **sum of their two highest scores** within the month. This means that even if you have multiple rounds in a month, only your top two performances will contribute to your monthly ranking.
